# DOM-Projects

One of the most unique and useful abilities of JavaScript is its ability to manipulate the DOM. But what is the DOM, and how do we go about changing it? So in this repo I dive deep exploring the DOM

# DOM - Document Object Model
The DOM (or Document Object Model) is a tree-like representation of the contents of a webpage - a tree of “nodes” with different relationships depending on how they’re arranged in the HTML document.

# Working with the DOM I have learned the following:

*What is DOM in relation to a webpage?
*What's the difference between a "node" and an "element"?
*How do you target nodes with "selectors"?
*What are the basic methods for finding/adding/removing and altering DOM nodes?
*What is the difference between a "nodelist" and an "array of nodes"?
*How do "events" and "listeners" work? What are three ways to use events in your code?
*How does "bubbling" work?
